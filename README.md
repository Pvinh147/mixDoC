# mixDoC: Mixture Direction of Causation Twin Model
### Overview
This repository contains the code for the paper titled "On the detection of population heterogeneity in causation between two variables: Finite mixture modeling of data collected from twin pairs". The project integrates the Direction of Causation (DoC) model with finite mixture modeling to identify heterogeneous causal relationships within twin data.

**mixCLPM.R** : Original script to fit the mixCLPM model.

**Sim_Model_Comparison.R** : Script to generate the fit statistics to compare the various mixture and non-mixture DoC models.

**Sim_Par_Effect.R** : Script to generate the entropy values when evaluating the effect of changing various parameters of the mixCLPM model.
