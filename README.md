# mixDoC: Mixture Direction of Causation Twin Model
### Overview
This repository contains the code for the paper titled "On the detection of population heterogeneity in causation between two variables: Finite mixture modeling of data collected from twin pairs". The project integrates the Direction of Causation (DoC) model with finite mixture modeling to identify heterogeneous causal relationships within twin data.
